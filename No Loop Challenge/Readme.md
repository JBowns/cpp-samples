# No Loop Challenge

Implement the following functionalities without (explicit) loops â€” no for, while, do while or recursion.

To facilitate testing, create a vector of 5 integers and fill it with ```{12, 10, -3, 24, 45}```

1. Print content of that vector
2. Fill a vector with 10 random integers
3. Remove all items from the vector
4. Fill a vector with 10 random integers between 0 & 1000
5. Find the max and min element in the vector and their respective positions in that vector
6. Replace every number in the vector with its negative
7. Calculate the sum of two vectors, storing the results in a third vector
8. Add all elements in a vector
9. Normalise the vector (divide all the elements by the largest)
10. Count the number of odd numbers in the vector
11. Remove all the odd numbers in the vector
12. Copy all the odd numbers from the vector into a list of double
13. Sort vector's content in ascending order
14. Sort vector's content in descending order
15. Store vector's content into reverse order in a list of int
16. Randomly shuffle the numbers in list
17. Remove all the odd numbers in the vector
18. Double all the numbers in the vector
19. Remove duplicates from a vector of integers
20. Remove duplicates from a file of integers
21. Calculate 6! using facilities in the STL
22. Print all anagrams of a word you type in
